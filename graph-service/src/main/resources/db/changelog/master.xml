    <!--
        There is an ongoing bug with spring and liquibase, which prevents us from using includeAll with fat jars.
        This bug is open since a few years and they don't get it. Even jhipster recommends to not use it.

        - http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/includeall.html
        - https://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE-2948
        - https://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE-2863
        - https://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE-2869
        - https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/698
        - https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/4034

        As a workaround we have to declare each migration.

    <include file="master-migrations.xml" relativeToChangelogFile="true"/>
    <include file="master-demo-data.xml" relativeToChangelogFile="true" labels="demo-data"/>
